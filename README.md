# Group-Project-2

Initial proposal:
Developing a dashboard that captures and displays Pokemon attributions/data in order to optimize team selection. First priority is to create a dashboard that allows for comparison among Types. If time, we’d like to create the ability to do radial comparisons for comparing the finer details of pokemon (hopefully against each other). We’ll use the Pokemon API for data, and store it in a SQL database.

We realized that there were datasets available that had all of the information we wanted to use, so we chose to use that instead of an API. We set up a SQL database and imported the information from the csv. We then set it up as a json that we used to call the information in our javascript files. We didn't include a link/route on the website for general users, but is available here (https://pokedreamteam.herokuapp.com/api/notes/postgres). We used Choreographer as our new js library to add a cool animation effect to our landing page so that the background changes color with the location of the mouse on the screen.
